# BillSplitter

This app is designed to quickly determine how a bill, or total costs should be split.
Enter the name of each person in the group, and the total amount they have contributed to the total costs.
Clicking "ADD PERSON" will create two new text fields, one for adding a new name, another for adding their amount contributed.
Clicking "CALCULATE" will calculate how much each person owes, or is owed based on the average.

The app is deployable on Android devices.
